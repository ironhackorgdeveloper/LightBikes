# Project #1: **The Game**

## Overview:

Let’s start with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges. It’s up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we’ll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you’ve got!

## REQUIREMENTS
**Your app must:**

- [ ] Render a game in the browser

- [ ] Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation

- [ ] Design logic for winning & visually display win/lose

- [ ] Be depoloyed online to GitHub Pages, where the rest of the world can access it

- [ ] Look visually appealing

---

## BEST PRACTICES REQUIRED
- [ ] Include **separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**.


- [ ] Create a separate folder for all your js files, one for all the images, one for all the css, etc. 


- [ ] You main page MUST be called **index.html**.


- [ ] You must have a **readme file** that include a description of the game, etc.(create one manually, do not check the box on github)


- [ ] Stick with **KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid) and **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.


- [ ] Make a mobile version for your game.


- [ ] Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS. (adhere to best practices)


- [ ] Make sure to indent your code. (you can use a plugin for VS code called beautify )



### BONUSES: 
- [ ] Switch turns between two players
- [ ] Create a mobile version 
- [ ] Make your game responsive

Necessary Deliverables:

- A working game, built by you that runs in the browser
- A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages
- A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Suggested Ways to Get Started.

## Presentation Guidelines and Criteria

#### Presentation Time: 5 minutes (we will time you and give you feedback)

### ATTIRE:

DRESS TO IMPRESS: Smart casual would be great (a suit a tie is not necessary)

### REQUIREMENTS

Presentation must be made on slides.com or google slides or prezi or something ON THE INTERNET, you will not be opening a powerpoint presentation because you will be presenting from Nick's computer.

Game must be deployed on github pages which we will go over on Thursday.

### PRESENTATION FORMAT
(*1 min*) **Part 1: Introduce yourself** - Tell us who you are, maybe a hobby that you have, perhaps you can talk about where you are from. (try to find something to mention about yourself that you can use to transition into talking about your game )---example: "Hi, my name is Maria and I am a devoted mother of two kids ages 2 and 4.  My son is completely obsessed with spongebob, so that's why I made this spongebob game."

(*1 min*) **Part 2: Explain what your game is** - Give us some context.  Not everyone knows the tv show/ video game/ thing that inspired you to make your game, so explain everything the audience needs to know.  (example: if your game is a spongebob game, explain what spongebob is, show a picture of spongebob.)And then explain the rules and how to play.

(*1 min*) **Part 3: The Code** - 
Take a screenshot or two of some of your code and take a minute to explain 1 or 2 specific things your did in your project.  Try to explain it in a way that a non-programmer would understand.  Mention a challenge that you faced and how you solved it or why you chose to change plans because of it. (also mention any exterior technologies you used like p5 or a physics engine or a simple server)

(*1 min*) **Part 4: Demo** - Play the game live on screen and talk.  

(*30 sec*) **Part 5: Off-Ramp -**
Mention a mistake you made, or something you wished you had done differently.  Also, tell us what would be next if you had another couple weeks to continue perfecting your project.

Tips
- You can find some sample landing pages at w3layouts.com/games (or by googling similar things)


- Break the project down into different steps (logic & data structures, layout and rendering, DOM manipulation & user interaction). Use whiteboards to conceptualize your game!


- Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems


- Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know… procrastinating


- Commit early, commit often, don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version


- Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to understand better the tools you are using & the available help you will get


- Don’t be afraid of the black screen, make it work and, if needed, refactor your code. If you need to create code (as in console.log) to test what you are doing, you can always delete it
